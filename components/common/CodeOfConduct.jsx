        <p>
          At Noma Collective, we believe in creating a safe, respectful, and supportive community for everyone. Our community is built on diversity, inclusivity, and shared experiences, and we ask all of our members, guests, and partners to uphold these values.
        </p>

        <h2>Inclusivity &amp; Understanding</h2>
        <p>
          We welcome people from all backgrounds, cultures, races, genders, sexual orientations, religions, and ideologies. With this diversity comes the responsibility to treat one another with empathy, kindness, and respect. We ask that you refrain from making comments or jokes about race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, politics, or national stereotypes.
        </p>

        <h2>Respectful Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Every interaction within our community should reflect mutual respect. Harassment, discrimination, sexual references, or unwelcome advances of any kind will not be tolerated. We aim to foster a professional and supportive environment where everyone feels safe, valued, and heard.
        </p>

        <h2>Safety &amp; Wellbeing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent matters:</strong> Always seek clear, enthusiastic consent before physical contact.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal boundaries:</strong> Respect everyoneâ€™s personal space and privacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Speaking up:</strong> If you witness or experience behaviour that feels unsafe, inappropriate, or harmful, we encourage you to report it and Team Noma will support in dealing with it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Supporting Local Communities</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission goes beyond travel. We are committed to contributing positively to the local communities that host us. We encourage members to support local businesses, embrace cultural traditions, and act with sustainability and respect toward the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Accountability</h2>
        <p>
          We take all concerns seriously. Anyone found violating this Code of Conduct may be asked to leave our community spaces or programs. Noma Collective is dedicated to addressing issues with care, confidentiality, and fairness.
        </p>

        <p>
          By being part of Noma Collective, you help create an environment where people feel welcome, supported, and inspired. Together, we can ensure our community thrives, not only for us, but for the people and places we connect with along the way.
