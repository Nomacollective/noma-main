          responsible for the receipt of payment and delivery of all other
          elements of the Noma Collective experience. This includes, but is not
          limited to, accommodation, food & beverage services, Property
          facilities (e.g. pool, bar, gym), internet, cleaning, and utilities.

          to receive all communication. If you are unable to use Slack, you may

          use it in a reasonable manner which does not offend or disrespect any
          other user. We reserve the right to remove you from Slack in the event
          of unreasonable behaviour.
        </p>

          the wider local community. These events may be moved, changed, amended
          or cancelled. Whilst we will make every effort to deliver our
          programme, by booking you acknowledge that we have no duty to deliver
          fixed events or events of a specific nature. We actively take on board
          feedback as to event ideas and feedback, however, we cannot guarantee
          that event ideas will be taken into account.

          the community manager know immediately and follow the local guidelines
          for quarantine.
        </p>

        <h2>Accuracy of Prices & Descriptions</h2>
        <p>
          Noma Collective cannot be held liable for errors or omissions in
          bookings or pricing, either made by the Property, or as a result of
          system failure of any kind. We reserve the right to amend advertised
          prices at any time prior to booking. We also reserve the right to
          correct errors in both advertised and confirmed prices. Special note:
          changes and errors sometimes occur. The prices offered when booking
          may increase due to demand and seasonality, this may affect the price
          of your booking if extending. We will act reasonably when resolving
          such issues.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Responsibility for Your Booking</h2>
        <p>
          Your contract is with the Property and its terms and conditions apply.
          As a marketing partner, we accept no responsibility for the actual
          provision of the arrangements. Our responsibilities are limited to
          making the booking in accordance with your instructions. We accept no
          responsibility for any information about the arrangements that we pass
          on to you in good faith.
        </p>

        <h2>Visa, Passport and Health Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          It is your own responsibility to ensure compliance with immigration,
          visa and health requirements of the country where the Property is
          located. Requirements may change and you are therefore strongly
          recommended to check the up to date information of the Passport
          Office, appropriate embassy or consulate or your doctor as applicable
          in a reasonable amount of time prior to your departure.
        </p>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Any cancellation of reservations or portions of reservations MUST be
          received in writing.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            60 days or more prior to arrival = The amount of the deposit made,
            minus 20% cancellation fee (of total trip price) + US$100 processing
            fee.
          </li>
          <li>0 - 60 days prior to arrival = No refund</li>
          <li>No show = No refund</li>
          <li>All shared accommodation is non-transferable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Due to the above it is HIGHLY recommended that all clients purchase
          “trip cancellation insurance” in order to cover a possible
          cancellation of 60 days or less of your itinerary.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes by You & Transfer of Booking</h2>
        <p>
          If you wish to change any part of your booking arrangements after the
          confirmation invoice has been issued, you must inform Noma as soon as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst we will do our best to assist, we cannot guarantee that we will
          be able to meet your requested change. Where we can meet a request,
          all changes will be subject to any applicable rate changes or extra
          costs incurred. You should be aware that these costs could increase
          the closer to the departure date that changes are made and you should
          contact us as soon as possible. Where we are unable to assist you and
          you do not wish to proceed with the original booking we will treat
          this as a cancellation and subject to the cancellation policy above.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any member of your party is prevented from travelling, that
          person(s) may transfer their place to someone else (introduced by you
          and satisfying all the conditions applicable to the arrangements). If
          they are not able to proceed with the original booking we will treat
          this as a cancellation and subject to the cancellation policy above.
        </p>

        <h2>Events Beyond Our Reasonable Control</h2>
        <p>
          We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply
          with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure
          arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. This
          condition does not affect your statutory rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Special Requests</h2>
        <p>
          If you have any special requests (for example dietary requirements,
          cots or room location), please let us know at the time of booking. We
          will make our best good faith efforts to ensure all requests are taken
          into account.
        </p>

        <h2>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Booking Conditions and any agreement to which they apply are
          governed in all respects by the country in which the Property is
          located. We both agree that any dispute, claim or other matter which
          arises between us out of or in connection with your contract or
          booking will be dealt with by the local governing body.
        </p>

        <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>
          Except where otherwise expressly stated in these booking conditions we
          will not be liable or pay you compensation if our contractual
          obligations to you are affected by any event which we or the
          supplier(s) of the service(s) in question could not, even with all due
          care, foresee or avoid. These events can include, but are not limited
          to war, threat of war, civil strife, terrorist activity and its
          consequences or the threat of such activity, riot, the act of any
          government or other national or local authority including port or
          river authorities, industrial dispute, lock closure, natural or
          nuclear disaster, fire, chemical or biological disaster and adverse
          weather, sea, ice and river conditions and all similar events outside
          our or the supplier(s) concerned’s control.
        </p>

        <h2>Disabilities and Medical Problems</h2>
        <p>
          We are not a specialist disabled holiday company, but we will do our
          utmost to cater for any special requirements you may have. If you or
          any member of your party has any medical problem or disability which
          may affect your stay, please provide us with full details before you
          make your booking so that we can try to advise you as to the
          suitability of your chosen arrangements. It is your responsibility to
          provide us with full and accurate details on any special assistance
          you may require. We may require you to produce a doctor’s certificate
          certifying that you are fit to participate in your chosen
          arrangements. Acting reasonably, if we are unable to properly
          accommodate the needs of the person(s) concerned, we will not confirm
          your booking or if you did not give us full details at the time of
          booking, we will cancel it and impose applicable cancellation charges
          when we become aware of these details.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Behaviour</h2>
        <p>
          All guests staying with us are expected to conduct themselves in an
          orderly and acceptable manner and not to disrupt the enjoyment of
          other guests. If in our opinion, or in the opinion of any other person
          in authority, your behaviour or that of any member of your party is
          causing or is likely to cause distress, danger or unreasonable
          annoyance to any of our other guests or any third party or damage to
          property, or to cause a delay or diversion to transportation, we
          reserve the right to terminate your booking arrangements immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of such termination our liability to you and/or your
          party will cease and you and/or your party will be required to leave
          your accommodation or other service immediately. We will have no
          further obligations to you and/or your party. No refunds for lost
          accommodation or any other service will be made and we will not pay
          any expenses or costs incurred as a result of termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and/or your party may also be required to pay for loss and/or
          damage caused by your actions and we will hold you and each member of
          your party jointly and individually liable for any damage or losses
          caused by you or any member of your party. Full payment for any such
          damage or losses must be paid directly to the Property or other
          supplier prior to departure. If you fail to make payment, you will be
          responsible for meeting any claims (including legal costs)
          subsequently made against us as a result of your actions together with
          all costs we incur in pursuing any claim against you. We cannot be
          held responsible for the actions or behaviour of other guests or
          individuals who have no connection with your booking arrangements or
          with us.
