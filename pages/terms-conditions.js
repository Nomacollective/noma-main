          limited to, accommodation, food & beverage services, Property

          fixed events or events of a specific nature. We actively take on board
          feedback as to event ideas and feedback, however, we cannot guarantee

        <h2>Our Responsibility for Your Booking</h2>
        <p>

          <li>Bookings made prior to August 19th, 2024:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              60 days or more prior to arrival = The amount of the deposit made,
              minus 20% cancellation fee of total trip price (before discounts)
              + US$100 processing fee.
            </li>
            <li>0 - 60 days prior to arrival = No refund</li>
            <li>No show = No refund</li>
            <li>All shared accommodation is non-transferable</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Bookings made after August 19th, 2024:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              90 days or more prior to arrival = The amount of the deposit made,
              minus 20% cancellation fee of total trip price (before discounts)
              + US$100 processing fee.
            </li>
            <li>0 - 90 days prior to arrival = No refund</li>
            <li>No show = No refund</li>
            <li>All shared accommodation is non-transferable</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Due to the above it is HIGHLY recommended that all clients purchase
          “trip cancellation insurance” in order to cover a possible
          cancellation of 60 days or less of your itinerary.
